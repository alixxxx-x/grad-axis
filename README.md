# Project – Internship Management Platform

## Unit
L3TI Workshop  
Academic Year: 2025–2026  

## Project Title
Project – Internship Management Platform

---

## Project Description

This is a full-stack web application designed to streamline internship management and facilitate connections between students and companies.  
The platform provides dedicated spaces for students, companies, and university administrators, handling internship applications, validation, and automatic document generation.  

The system allows role-based access, centralized tracking of applications, and skill-based matching between students and companies.  
Administrators can validate internships and generate PDF agreements automatically, while students can apply to offers and companies can manage applications efficiently.  

This project is the **final graduation project** for the Computer Science program, demonstrating full-stack development and deployment skills.
